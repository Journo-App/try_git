READ ME
This is where I do all my experimenting as Github and I get fully acquainted 
I. 1. Create repo in GitHub that mirrors your local repo (i.e. folder), like, for this purpose: try_git 
2. go to the terminal and type: 
mkdir ~/try_git
cd ~/try_git 
git init 
touch README 
3. Open the local repo (folder), find the REAME file and open it in your text editor and add info about the project 
4. Save; close README file 
5. Commmit README to Github repo: 
git add README (this stages the changes) 
git commit -m "first commit" 
6. Push your commit to Github: 
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/reponame.git (which would look like this here: https://github.cm/Journo-App/try_git.git)
7. Then push the changes to Github: 
git push -u origin master 

II. To push an existing local repo to Github repo: 
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/reponame.git 
git push -u origin master 

III. To make changes to an existing file on the local repo and push to Github: 
Pull changes if necessary first 
1. Open the file (in this example it's called README) and make the changes. Save and close 
2. git add README
3. git commit -m "the text you want to show up under your commit message that tells others what you've done" 
4. git push -u origin master
