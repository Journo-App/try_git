READ ME
This is where I do all my experimenting as Github and I get fully acquainted 

Pull changes if necessary first: git pull origin master

I. 1. Create repo in GitHub and then a local repo (i.e. folder) that mirrors it, like, for this purpose: try_git (BUT! your local folder can have a different name than your Github repo)
2. go to the terminal and type: 
mkdir ~/try_git (you are making the local directory) 
cd try_git (you are switching into that local directory)
git init (you are initializing that local directory)
touch README (creating the README file in that local directory) 
3. Open the local repo (folder), find the REAME file and open it in your text editor and add info about the project 
4. Save; close README file 
Everything is still only on your computer (i.e. local) 
5. Commmit README to Github repo: 
git add README (this stages the changes) 
git commit -m "first commit" 
6. Push your commit to Github: 
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/reponame.git (which would look like this here: https://github.cm/Journo-App/try_git.git)
7. Then push the changes to Github: 
8. git push -u origin master 

II. To push an existing local repo to Github repo: 
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/reponame.git 
git push -u origin master 

III. To make changes to an existing file on the local repo and push to Github: 
Pull changes if necessary first: git pull origin master
1. Open the file (in this example it's called README) and make the changes. Save and close 
2. git add README
3. git commit -m "the text you want to show up under your commit message that tells others what you've done" 
4. git push -u origin master

? Alternative method: You have created a new repo -- test.git in this example -- in Github and have a local one too: 
1. touch README.md (***I am not sure why github's instructions put the .md at the end and other tutorials don't ***) 
2. git init
3. git add README.md
4. git commit -m "first commit"
5. git remote add origin https://github.com/Journo-App/Test.git
6. git push -u origin master
